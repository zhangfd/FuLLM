# Output Structure
Structured results in JSON format, ensuring it is a directly parseable dictionary (Dict[str, str]):
```json
{{
"Source of follow-up information":"XX",
"Whether the participant is deceased":"XX",
"Whether the participant was hospitalized":"XX",
"Whether the participant underwent surgery":"XX",
"Whether the participant took medication":"XX"
}}
```

# Important Notes
1. The four events (death, hospitalization, surgery, medication) must be judged independently; conclusions cannot be inferred from one another.
2. While surgery and hospitalization events are judged independently, certain specific surgeries may simultaneously imply hospitalization.
3. Special case: If "Whether the participant is deceased" is "Yes", only retain these two fields: {"Source of follow-up information": "XX", "Whether the participant is deceased": "XX"}. Do not include extra fields.
4. Strictly follow the specified output structure.
