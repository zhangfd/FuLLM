# Task
Based on the follow-up conversation, parse the follow-up report according to the reasoning process. Finally, provide the reasoning thought process and structured results.

# Fields to Extract
1. Source of follow-up information
2. Whether the participant is deceased
3. Whether the participant was hospitalized
4. Whether the participant underwent surgery
5. Whether the participant took medication

# Field Definitions and Determination Methods

## 1. Source of follow-up information
- Definition: Whether the follow-up participant is the person themselves
- Value Range: ["Self", "Relative"]
- Determination Method: Comprehensively analyze the dialogue content to determine if the follow-up was received by the participant themselves.

## 2. Whether the participant is deceased
- Definition: Life status of the participant
- Value Range: ["Yes", "No"]
- Determination Method:
  - "Yes": Relative explicitly mentions the participant's death.
  - "No": All other situations.

## 3. Whether the participant was hospitalized
- Definition: Whether the participant received inpatient treatment during the follow-up period
- Value Range: ["Yes", "No", "Not Mentioned", "Uncertain"]
- Determination Method:
  - "Yes":
    - Explicit mention of hospitalization.
    - Situations implying hospitalization: Stent placement, bypass surgery, valve replacement, invasive cerebral angiography.
  - "No":
    - Explicit denial of hospitalization.
    - Mention of no follow-up exams or only health check-ups.
    - Mention of angiography without specifying DSA or CTA.
    - Treatment received only at a community hospital.
  - "Not Mentioned": No relevant information.
  - "Uncertain": Participant's illogical or contradictory statements preventing a clear judgment.

## 4. Whether the participant underwent surgery
- Definition: Whether the participant received surgical treatment during the follow-up period
- Value Range: ["Yes", "No", "Not Mentioned", "Uncertain"]
- Determination Method:
  - "Yes":
    - Explicit mention of surgery.
    - Specific surgery types: stent, bypass, valve replacement, DSA, etc.
  - "No":
    - Explicit denial of surgery.
    - Mention of only medication prescription or conservative treatment.
  - "Not Mentioned": No relevant information.
  - "Uncertain": Participant's illogical or contradictory statements preventing a clear judgment.

## 5. Whether the participant took medication
- Definition: Whether the participant used medication during the follow-up period
- Value Range: ["Yes", "No", "Not Mentioned", "Uncertain"]
- Determination Method:
  - "Yes": Medication used during follow-up (regardless of discontinuation).
  - "No": All other situations.
  - "Not Mentioned": No relevant information.
  - "Uncertain": Participant's illogical or contradictory statements preventing a clear judgment.
 
# Output Structure
The output should include 2 parts:

Part 1: Under the title ## Reasoning, describe the reasoning process in detail.
Part 2: Structured results output in JSON format, ensuring it is a directly parseable dictionary (Dict[str, str]), formatted as follows:
```json
{{
"Source of follow-up information":"XX",
"Whether the participant is deceased":"XX",
"Whether the participant was hospitalized":"XX",
"Whether the participant underwent surgery":"XX",
"Whether the participant took medication":"XX"
}}
```

# Important Notes
1. The four events (death, hospitalization, surgery, medication) must be judged independently; they cannot be inferred from each other.
2. Surgery and hospitalization events are judged independently, but specific surgeries can simultaneously imply hospitalization.
3. Specifically, if the prediction for 'Whether the participant is deceased:' is "Yes", then only retain the following two pieces of information: {{"Source of follow-up information":"XX", "Whether the participant is deceased":"XX"}}. Do not include extra information.
4. Think according to the reasoning process below, then output the result according to the output structure.

# Reasoning Process
Refer to the following reasoning process to derive the answers:
When answering each question, think step by step. First, locate key statements useful for judgment, then sequentially compare against the determination methods in # Field Definitions and Determination Methods. Select the most appropriate option from the value range as the answer, and output according to the output structure.
