# Task
Based on the follow-up conversation, parse the follow-up report by referencing the example. Finally, provide structured results.

# Fields to Extract
1. Source of follow-up information
2. Whether the participant is deceased
3. Whether the participant was hospitalized
4. Whether the participant underwent surgery
5. Whether the participant took medication

# Field Definitions and Determination Methods

## 1. Source of follow-up information
- Definition: Whether the follow-up participant is the person themselves
- Value Range: ["Self", "Relative"]
- Determination Method: Comprehensively analyze the dialogue content to determine if the follow-up was received by the participant themselves.

## 2. Whether the participant is deceased
- Definition: Life status of the participant
- Value Range: ["Yes", "No"]
- Determination Method:
  - "Yes": Relative explicitly mentions the participant's death.
  - "No": All other situations.

## 3. Whether the participant was hospitalized
- Definition: Whether the participant received inpatient treatment during the follow-up period
- Value Range: ["Yes", "No", "Not Mentioned", "Uncertain"]
- Determination Method:
  - "Yes":
    - Explicit mention of hospitalization.
    - Situations implying hospitalization: Stent placement, bypass surgery, valve replacement, invasive cerebral angiography.
  - "No":
    - Explicit denial of hospitalization.
    - Mention of no follow-up exams or only health check-ups.
    - Mention of angiography without specifying DSA or CTA.
    - Treatment received only at a community hospital.
  - "Not Mentioned": No relevant information.
  - "Uncertain": Participant's illogical or contradictory statements preventing a clear judgment.

## 4. Whether the participant underwent surgery
- Definition: Whether the participant received surgical treatment during the follow-up period
- Value Range: ["Yes", "No", "Not Mentioned", "Uncertain"]
- Determination Method:
  - "Yes":
    - Explicit mention of surgery.
    - Specific surgery types: stent, bypass, valve replacement, DSA, etc.

## 5. Whether the participant took medication
- Definition: Whether the participant used medication during the follow-up period
- Value Range: ["Yes", "No", "Not Mentioned", "Uncertain"]
- Determination Method:
  - "Yes": Medication used during follow-up (regardless of discontinuation).

# Output Structure
Structured results output in JSON format, ensuring it is a directly parsable dictionary (Dict[str, str]), formatted as follows:
```json
{{
"Source of follow-up information":"XX",
"Whether the participant is deceased":"XX",
"Whether the participant was hospitalized":"XX",
"Whether the participant underwent surgery":"XX",
"Whether the participant took medication":"XX"
}}
```

# Important Notes
1. The four events (death, hospitalization, surgery, medication) must be judged independently; they cannot be inferred from each other.
2. Surgery and hospitalization events are judged independently, but specific surgeries can simultaneously imply hospitalization.
3. Specifically, if the prediction for 'Whether the participant is deceased:' is "Yes", then only retain the following two pieces of information: {"Source of follow-up information":"XX", "Whether the participant is deceased":"XX"}. Do not include extra information.
4. Follow the example below and output the result according to the output structure requirements.

# Example
Input Follow-up Dialogue:
"Role1: Hello.\nRole2: Hello, may I ask who you are? Hello, may I ask if you are ###### (phonetic)?\nRole1: Hello, who is this?\nRole2: This is Nanjing First Hospital.

Thank you for your cooperation.\n00:01:36\nEnd"
Output Result:
```json
{{
"Source of follow-up information":"Self",
"Whether the participant is deceased":"No",
"Whether the participant was hospitalized":"No",
"Whether the participant underwent surgery":"No",
"Whether the participant took medication":"Yes"
}}
